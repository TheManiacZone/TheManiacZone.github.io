    Hi Maniac, this is the zone. /n
    
    I actually had a couple ideas on what to do as a gift for you before you left for uni
    but since I can't send you physical gifts (yet) I was thinking of doing something like
    a drawing or a roblox game but I realized those were both temporary gifts and I wanted
    to be able to be present for you even when we both had to deal with intense academic
    torture labyrinths and I eventually got the idea of making everything I can and bundling
    them up in one big gift like this. This is the Maniac_Zone, where you'll find some pictures,
    letters and minigames and other stuff I made for u ‚ù§Ô∏è /n
    
    I hope you enjoy
  </p>
