      Hi Maniac, this is the zone. <br><br>
      I actually had a couple ideas on what to do as a gift for you before you left for uni
      but since I can't send you physical gifts (yet) I was thinking of doing something like
      a drawing or a roblox game but I realized those were both temporary gifts and I wanted
      to be able to be present for you even when we both had to deal with intense academic
      torture labyrinths and I eventually got the idea of making everything I can and bundling
      them up in one big gift like this. This is the Maniac_Zone, where you'll find some pictures,
      letters and minigames and other stuff I made for u ❤️ <br><br>
      I hope you enjoy
    </p>
